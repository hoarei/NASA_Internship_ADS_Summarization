# NASA_Internship_ADS_Summarization
Summarization model for ADS_search program developed in tandem with NASA HQ and other interns during Fall 2023

**Purpose:** This repository is the result of my Fall 2023 Internship with NASA HQ. The goal was the enhance tools that have been created by previous interns that will enable NASA Headquarters Astrophysics Program Scientists to identify the expertise of potential peer reviewers based on their publication history through the NASA ADS archive. 

The goal of creating this expertise finder is to use the tool to find possible reviewers at underserved and small research insitutions that normally do not particpate in the proposal process. Our hope is that by directly reaching out to subject matter experts at these insitutions, we can divserify the overall pool of applicants to NASA Astrophysics funds in the future. 

This code represents an enhanced version of Expertise Finder v2.0, developed by Mallory Helfenbein (https://github.com/MalloryHelfenbein/NASA_Internship) and MÃ¡ire Volz (https://github.com/maireav/NASA-Internship). The results of Expertise Finder v2.0 must be used for this code to function properly.
